# cppong

World's greatest pong clone written in C++11, using
 [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php).

## Build instructions

For POSIX systems, once SDL2 has been installed, modify any variables in the
Makefile to the desired value and run `make`. The executable `pongclient` will
be built.
